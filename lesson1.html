    <h1>Lesson 1</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to Intro to JavaScript!</h2>

    <p id="par">
      Programming can be a difficult skill to pick up. But, with this unit of
      Programmingo!, JavaScript will become much easier to understand and
      implement.
    </p>

    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

    <p id="par2">
      JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language that allows developers to
      create multimedia web pages that are easily controlled and manipulated
      when used alongside HTML and CSS. Creator Brenden Eich took inspiration
      from Java, Self, and Scheme to create JavaScript in 1995. This was done
      because Netscape Communications, a company that created the Netscape
      Navigator browser, wanted to make their webpages more dynamic, with
      multimedia applications and activity.
    </p>

    <h3>The Basics: The Works and How They Work</h3>

    <h4>Console</h4>

    <p>
      In JavaScript, the console is a panel that allows you to watch your code
      in action. The console prints, or logs, the output of your code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within JavaScript, there are objects and methods. Objects are templates
      that contain properties that allow programmers to define certain aspects
      of an object, along with methods that can be called on objects to perform
      certain actions.
    </p>

    <p>All right, so: objects, methods, properties.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Console</strong> refers to an object, and various methods can be
      called on this object to have it perform certain actions. For example,
      <strong>.log()</strong> allows anything inside the parantheses to be
      logged to the console (panel).
    </p>

    <img
      src="img/Screen Shot 2024-06-01 at 8.07.53 PM.jpg"
      alt="Photo of Creator"
    />

    <p>This line of code will cause this to be logged to the console:</p>
    <img
      src="img/Screen Shot 2024-06-01 at 8.22.03 PM.jpg"
      alt="Photo of
    Creator"
      width="500"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Statements don't need to be followed by a
      semi-colon in JavaScript. There are cases in which they are required, so
      it's better to get in the habit of using them. Many languages, including
      Java, which JavaScript includes many elements of, actually require
      semi-colons.
    </p>

    <p>
      This can even be done with a <strong>data type</strong> known as
      <strong>strings</strong>. Strings are always surrounded by quotation marks
      <strong>("")</strong> or single quotes <strong>('')</strong> and include
      letters, numbers,spaces, or symbols.
    </p>

    <img
      src="img/Screen Shot 2024-06-01 at 8.34.30 PM.jpg"
      alt="Photo of
    Creator"
      width="500"
    />

    <p>
      Both of these statements will cause <strong>Hello World!</strong> to be
      logged to the console.
    </p>

    <h4>Data Types and Variables</h4>

    <p>
      We just took a look at logging strings to the console. But what really is
      a string?
    </p>

    <p>
      A string is one of many data types in JavaScript.
      <strong>Data types</strong> represent the types of data that can be stored
      as variables. There are two types of data types (LOL): primitive and
      non-primitive. Primitive types can only hold one singular value, while
      non-primitive types can hold several values.
    </p>

    <p>For now, let's focus on primitive types. Primitive types include:</p>

    <section id="primtypes">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>String:</strong> holds text in quotation marks or single
          quotes
        </li>
        <li><strong>Number:</strong> holds any number</li>
        <li>
          <strong>BigInt:</strong> holds any number less than -2^63 and greater
          than 2^63-1
        </li>
        <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> logical; holds true and false values</li>
        <li><strong>Null:</strong> the variable has no value</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Undefined:</strong> the variables has not yet been assigned a
          value
        </li>
        <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> represet and return unique identifiers</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>
      <strong>Variables</strong> can be defined using one of three keywords:
    </p>

    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>var:</strong> can be used in any situation; should only be
          used for older browsers
        </li>
        <li><strong>let:</strong> allows variables to be reassigned</li>
        <li>
          <strong>const:</strong> cannot be reassigned after its instantiation
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h4>Arithmetic Operators and Concatenation</h4>

    <p>Yay! Time for math!</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Operators</strong> are used to perform a certain action in code.
      Arithmetic perators help perform calculations. Arithmetic operators in
      JavaScript include:
    </p>

    <section>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>+:</strong> addition</li>
        <li><strong>-:</strong> subtraction</li>
        <li><strong>*:</strong> multiplication</li>
        <li><strong>/:</strong> division</li>
        <li><strong>%:</strong> remainder/modulo</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>
      The arithmetic operator + is also used to concatenate strings.
      <strong>Concatetenation</strong> is the connection of strings using an
      operator. This can be done to strings and variables that contain strings.
      Here is an example of string concatenation within a
      <strong>console.log()</strong>
      statement.
    </p>

    <img
      src="img/Screen Shot 2024-06-02 at 4.37.34 PM.jpg"
      alt="Example"
      width="500"
    />

    <p>This is what is logged to the console:</p>

    <img
      src="img/Screen Shot 2024-06-02 at 4.41.24 PM.jpg"
      alt="Example"
      width="500"
    />

    <p>This can also be done with variables. For example:</p>

    <img
      src="img/Screen Shot 2024-06-02 at 4.44.53 PM.jpg"
      alt="Example"
      width="500"
    />
    <p>This same output can be seen in the console:</p>
    <img
      src="img/Screen Shot 2024-06-02 at 4.41.24 PM.jpg"
      alt="Example"
      width="500"
    />

    <h3>Wrap It Up!</h3>

    <p>
      To Wrap It Up!, JavaScript is a dynamic language created to make webpages
      dynamic and interactive. It usually goes hand-in-hand with HTML and CSS in
      order to design and add content to webpages. Code can be printed, or
      logged, to a panel called the console using the statement
      <strong>console.log().</strong> Within the parantheses can be values of a
      variety of <strong>data types</strong>, including Strings, Numbers,
      BigInts, etc. Values of any of these data types can also be assigned to
      <strong>variables</strong> that will store them for later use.
      <strong>Arithmetic operators,</strong> such as + and -, can be used to
      perform mathematical operations on numerical values. The operator + can be
      used for <strong>concatenation.</strong>
